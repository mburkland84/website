		<h2>Values and Experience</h2>

			<p>Ginger has been a concerned member of the community her whole life. When she's not in the house, she sits outside and watches the neighborhood for intruders or guards her citizens as they move around the yard. In 2016, she was voted Town Supervisor of Perinton, NY, where she spent two years improving the community and adding many parks and walking trails. Perinton is known as Trail Town USA and she believed building on that was the key to success. After a successful two years as the Perinton Town Supervisor, she was elected as the United States Representative of the Rochester area, replacing Louise Slaughter.</p>

			<p>Ginger can often be seen walking around her hometown, greeting constituients. She loves long walks along the Erie Canal and finding interesting scents. Ginger loves how Fairport has so many concerned and involved citizens that truly care about their community. She loves the variety of events the town puts on and believes that public events add an inherent value to the town by building a strong community. She hopes to translate these values to the presidency and help make America a strong, connected community. </p>

			<p>Ginger believes that healthcare is a human- and animal- right. Her proposal for universal healthcare is modeled after Canada. Since she too previously suffered from seizures, hot spots, food allergies, and bad ear infections, she's seen how those medical bills can rack up.</p>

			<p>Under Ginger's administration, all animals will receive 150% more pets and longer walks. Her proposed bill, "Fido's Freedom", will allow all humans to only work for four hours a day and spend more time with their pets. The bond an owner and a pet share is unique and she wants to help strengthen that bond.</p>
